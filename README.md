### Brief Description of the Project :eyes: 
This is a social media web application designed for food lovers and reviewers, built using Spring Boot for the backend and REST API for data communication, and React JS 
for the frontend. The application allows users to create profiles, search and follow other users, and share their food experiences by posting reviews and photos of their 
favorite dishes.To further enhance the user experience, the application can also allow users to add comments to the reviews and posts shared by other users. This will 
encourage more engagement and interaction among users and help build a sense of community on the platform.
